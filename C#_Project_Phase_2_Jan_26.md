<p align="center"><b> Introduction </p>

Greetings,

Would I be correct to say knowledge is power? Well Miles Kington said, “Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.” Which made me think I do not want to have a great wealth of knowledge and not know how to apply it in practical application. But I want to be able to apply that knowledge in an effective manner to be considered wise. The application that I have chosen to assist me in accomplishing that goal is Games of Sofia also know as Sofia’s Games. The purpose of this application is to allow people and additional tool when it comes to studying for an exam, or reinforcement learning.

The type of data that will be needed for this project will be primary be used as tables. One table to consist of answers and the other will consist of questions. The current phase I am in with this is finding a subject that I be using to create the questions and answers around. Secondary data will be images for user interface. As the application develops users will be able to input their own data and create, they’re on Sofia games and cards.
I am currently in the 1st phase of the software development lifecycle which is the requirements and analysis phase as well as embarking into the second phase which is design. In order to accomplish this project, I will need to scope out the initial requirements for content, basic functionality, targeted audience, and timeline for feasible working product.

The initial interface will be simple as a multiple-choice selection, flash cards, and game that will resemble that as duck hunter.
ideally the of building this project will initially take the basic steps as a console application that will run in a command window. That will take user input and present an output to understand how the program will initial work. From there I will add basic user interface with the same logic in mind. That lastly go into integrating the duck game into the project.
